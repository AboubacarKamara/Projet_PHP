Thanks for reading this file and the rest of my code ! 

This was my first laminas project I struggled a bit at the beginning but Iâ€™m glad I learned how to use Laminas which is a very practical tool. I know sometimes I didn't use the right/easiest way to do some tasks but I tried my best.

I also had to prepare my internship defense which was Friday, August 2, which I have been informed after communicating my delivery date.

I have 2 issue that I don't know how to fix, first I don't know how (and if I need to) translate the information about the drug stored in the database and second How to translate the error some error on forms message. I tried something but I don't know how to get all the error messages and trasnlate them.
